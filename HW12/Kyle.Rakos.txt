No, C2 just removed c.
Now c1 is in the blocked queue waiting for a character to be added to buffer.
If no while loop the program would try to take a character from the buffer when nothing is there

Yes, P3, C2, or C3 could be selected.
It would wake up all the threads and allow C2 or C3 to grab the character and then proceed to execute the rest of the P and C functions
